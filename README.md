# Xurich-I
GEANT4 package for gamma scattering simualtions with the Xurich-I TPC

The code contains full and detailed geometry of the Xurich-II dual-phase xenon time-projection chamber, together with an experimental setup for Compton scattering measurements.

The results from the simulations were used in the data analysis for measurements of the xenon responce to low-energy electromagnetic interactions, detailed in:
